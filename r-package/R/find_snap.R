#' Find snapped locations of input points on street network
#'
#' Finds the snapped location of points on `R5` network. Snapping is a very
#' important step of the routing process, which is when the origins and
#' destinations specified by the user are actually positioned on the network
#' created by `R5`. The snapping process in `R5` is composed of two rounds.
#' First, it tries to snap the points within a radius of 300 meters from
#' themselves. If the first round is unsuccessful, then `R5` expands the search
#' to the radius specified (by default 1.6km). If yet again it is unsuccessful,
#' then the unsnapped points won't be used during the routing process. The
#' snapped location of each point depends on the transport mode set by the user,
#' because some network edges are not available to specific modes (e.g. a
#' pedestrian-only street cannot be used to snap car trips).
#'
#' @template r5r_core
#' @param points Either a `POINT sf` object with WGS84 CRS, or a `data.frame`
#' containing the columns `id`, `lon` and `lat`.
#' @param radius Numeric. The maximum radius in meters within which to snap.
#' Defaults to 1600m.
#' @param mode A string. Which mode to consider when trying to snap the points
#' to the network. Defaults to `WALK`, also allows `BICYCLE` and `CAR`.
#'
#' @return A `data.table` with the original points, their respective
#' snapped coordinates on the street network and the Euclidean distance (in
#' meters) between the original points and their snapped location. Points that
#' could not be snapped show `NA` coordinates and `found = FALSE`.
